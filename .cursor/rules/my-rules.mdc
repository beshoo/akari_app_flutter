- Do not use deprecated flutter members , eg 'withOpacity' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use .withValues() to avoid precision loss Try replacing the use of the deprecated member with the replacement.dartdeprecated_member_use

- Use a 'SizedBox' to add whitespace to a layout.
Try using a 'SizedBox' rather than a 'Container'.dartsized_box_for_whitespace
- Do not use print or debugPrint , use Logger.log()
- Do not create example or Demo pages at all
- Whn you want to use spinner , use CustomSpinner(size: 50.0) not CircularProgressIndicator()
