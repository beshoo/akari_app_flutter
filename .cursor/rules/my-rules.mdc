- Do not use deprecated flutter members , eg 'withOpacity' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use .withValues() to avoid precision loss Try replacing the use of the deprecated member with the replacement.dartdeprecated_member_use

- Use a 'SizedBox' to add whitespace to a layout.
Try using a 'SizedBox' rather than a 'Container'.dartsized_box_for_whitespace
- Do not use print or debugPrint , use Logger.log()
- Do not create example or Demo pages at all
- Whn you want to use spinner , use CustomSpinner(size: 50.0) not CircularProgressIndicator()
- ðŸ”§ CROSS-PLATFORM UI ALERT: Please ensure all floating/positioned UI elements (FABs, bottom sheets, modals, bottom nav bars, overlays) properly handle iOS/Android safe areas. Watch for hardcoded bottom/top positioning that doesn't account for iOS home indicator, notches, or dynamic islands. Use MediaQuery.of(context).viewPadding or SafeArea widgets for consistent cross-platform positioning.
