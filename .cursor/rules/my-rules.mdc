- Do not use deprecated flutter members , eg 'withOpacity' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use .withValues() to avoid precision loss Try replacing the use of the deprecated member with the replacement.dartdeprecated_member_use

- Use a 'SizedBox' to add whitespace to a layout.
Try using a 'SizedBox' rather than a 'Container'.dartsized_box_for_whitespace
