# üöÄ App Store Build & Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to build and deploy the Akari Flutter app to **Google Play Store (Android)** and **App Store (iOS)**.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Tools
- **Flutter SDK** (latest stable version)
- **Android Studio** with Android SDK (for Android builds)
- **Xcode** (latest version, macOS only - for iOS builds)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
- **PowerShell** (for Windows build scripts)
- **macOS** (required for iOS builds)

### Store Setup
#### Google Play Console (Android)
1. **Google Play Developer Account** ($25 one-time fee)
2. **App created** in Google Play Console
3. **Upload key generated** and configured

#### App Store Connect (iOS)
1. **Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)
2. **App created** in App Store Connect
3. **iOS certificates and provisioning profiles** configured

---

## üîê Step 1: Generate Upload Key (First Time Only)

### Create Upload Key
```cmd
keytool -genkey -v -keystore upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

**Important:** 
- Store the keystore file in a secure location
- Remember the passwords (you'll need them for every build)
- **Never commit the keystore to version control**

### Configure Key Properties
Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=../upload-keystore.jks
```

### Update android/app/build.gradle.kts
Add this configuration (should already be done):
```kotlin
android {
    ...
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias = keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword = keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile = file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])
            storePassword = keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.release
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üì¶ Step 2: Version Management

### Understanding Flutter Versioning
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
version: 1.2.3+45
#        ^^^^^ ^^
#        |     build number (internal, must increase for each upload)
#        version name (what users see: major.minor.patch)
```

### Version Increment Scripts

#### Option A: Interactive Batch File (Easiest)
```cmd
# Double-click or run:
increment_version.bat
```
**Menu Options:**
1. **Build number only** - For quick builds/testing
2. **Patch version** - Bug fixes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
3. **Minor version** - New features (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
4. **Major version** - Breaking changes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)

#### Option B: PowerShell Commands (Advanced)
```powershell
# Patch release (recommended for most updates)
.\increment_version_advanced.ps1 -Type patch -Build

# Minor release (new features)
.\increment_version_advanced.ps1 -Type minor -Build

# Major release (breaking changes)
.\increment_version_advanced.ps1 -Type major -Build

# Just increment build number (for testing)
.\increment_version_advanced.ps1 -Type build -Build
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 3: Build for Production

### Automated Build (Recommended)
Use the version increment scripts which automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. ‚úÖ Clean the project
3. ‚úÖ Get dependencies
4. ‚úÖ Build signed AAB file

### Manual Build Process
If you prefer manual steps:

```cmd
# 1. Clean project
flutter clean

# 2. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Build Android App Bundle (AAB)
flutter build appbundle --release

# 4. Verify build
echo "AAB file location: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab"
```

---

## üì± Step 4: Pre-Upload Verification

### Check AAB File
```cmd
# Verify the AAB file exists
dir build\app\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab

# Check file size (should be reasonable, typically 10-50MB)
```

### Test Installation (Optional)
```cmd
# Install AAB locally for testing (requires bundletool)
java -jar bundletool.jar build-apks --bundle=build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab --output=test.apks --mode=universal
java -jar bundletool.jar install-apks --apks=test.apks
```

---

## üöÄ Step 5: Upload to Google Play Store

### Google Play Console Steps

1. **Login** to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/)

2. **Select Your App**

3. **Navigate to Release Management**
   - Go to "Release" ‚Üí "Production" (or "Internal testing" for first upload)

4. **Create New Release**
   - Click "Create new release"

5. **Upload AAB File**
   - Click "Browse files"
   - Select: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
   - Wait for upload and processing

6. **Review Release Details**
   - ‚úÖ Version name should match your pubspec.yaml
   - ‚úÖ Version code should be incremented
   - ‚úÖ File size should be reasonable

7. **Add Release Notes**
   ```
   Version 1.2.3:
   - Bug fixes and improvements
   - New features added
   - Performance optimizations
   ```

8. **Review and Rollout**
   - Click "Review release"
   - Choose rollout percentage (100% for full release)
   - Click "Start rollout to production"

```powershell
param(
    [string]$Type = "build",  # Options: "build", "patch", "minor", "major"
    [switch]$Build = $false   # Build after incrementing
)

# Read current version from pubspec.yaml
$content = Get-Content pubspec.yaml
$versionLine = $content | Where-Object { $_ -match "^version:" }
$versionParts = $versionLine -split "\+"
$versionName = ($versionParts[0] -split ":")[1].Trim()
$buildNumber = [int]$versionParts[1]

Write-Host "Current version: $versionName+$buildNumber"

# Parse version name parts
$versionNameParts = $versionName -split "\."
$major = [int]$versionNameParts[0]
$minor = [int]$versionNameParts[1]
$patch = [int]$versionNameParts[2]

$newVersionName = $versionName
$newBuildNumber = $buildNumber

switch ($Type) {
    "build" {
        $newBuildNumber = $buildNumber + 1
        Write-Host "Incrementing build number..."
    }
    "patch" {
        $patch = $patch + 1
        $newVersionName = "$major.$minor.$patch"
        $newBuildNumber = 1
        Write-Host "Incrementing patch version..."
    }
    "minor" {
        $minor = $minor + 1
        $patch = 0
        $newVersionName = "$major.$minor.$patch"
        $newBuildNumber = 1
        Write-Host "Incrementing minor version..."
    }
    "major" {
        $major = $major + 1
        $minor = 0
        $patch = 0
        $newVersionName = "$major.$minor.$patch"
        $newBuildNumber = 1
        Write-Host "Incrementing major version..."
    }
}

# Update pubspec.yaml
$newContent = $content -replace "version: $versionName\+$buildNumber", "version: $newVersionName+$newBuildNumber"
$newContent | Set-Content pubspec.yaml -Force

Write-Host "Version updated from $versionName+$buildNumber to $newVersionName+$newBuildNumber"

if ($Build) {
    Write-Host "`nBuilding iOS app..."
    
    # Clean project
    flutter clean
    
    # Get dependencies
    flutter pub get
    
    # Build iOS app
    flutter build ios --release
    
    Write-Host "`nTo complete the build:"
    Write-Host "1. Open ios/Runner.xcworkspace in Xcode"
    Write-Host "2. Select 'Any iOS Device (arm64)' as target"
    Write-Host "3. Product ‚Üí Archive"
    Write-Host "4. Upload to App Store Connect"
}
```

### iOS Build Process

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Errors

**Issue: Build fails with signing errors**
```
Solution: Check android/key.properties file exists and passwords are correct
```

**Issue: "Duplicate files" error**
```
Solution: Add to android/app/build.gradle.kts:
android {
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst '**/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst '**/libjsc.so'
    }
}
```

**Issue: Version code not incrementing**
```
Solution: Always use the increment scripts, don't manually edit pubspec.yaml
```

### Android Upload Issues

**Issue: "You uploaded an APK that is not zip aligned"**
```
Solution: Use AAB file, not APK. AAB files are automatically optimized.
```

**Issue: "Version code X has already been used"**
```
Solution: Increment version using the scripts before building
```

**Issue: "Upload certificate doesn't match"**
```
Solution: Use the same upload-keystore.jks file for all builds
```

### iOS Build & Upload Issues

**Issue: "No profiles for 'com.example.akari_app' were found"**
```
Solution: Create and install Distribution Provisioning Profile in Apple Developer Portal
```

**Issue: "Code signing error: No code signing identities found"**
```
Solution: Install Distribution Certificate in Keychain Access
```

**Issue: "Archive failed: Build input file cannot be found"**
```
Solution: Run 'flutter build ios --release' before opening Xcode
```

**Issue: "Firebase/Messaging module not found"**
```
Solution: Ensure GoogleService-Info.plist is added to Xcode project and Runner target
```

**Issue: "App Store Connect upload fails with ITMS-90xxx error"**
```
Solution: Check Info.plist configurations and ensure all required icons are present
```

**Issue: "TestFlight build not appearing"**
```
Solution: Wait 10-30 minutes for processing, check email for processing notifications
```
